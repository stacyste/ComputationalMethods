# Computational Method Implementation

## Introduction
This repository contains a set of computational statistical methods implemented by hand to showcase the mechanisms by which we solve some of the fundamental
models of every statistician's toolkit. These methods are implemented in multiple programming languages: R, Rcpp, Python, and SAS.

## Included Methods
- Linear Regression  
	- by Gauss Jordan Elimination  
	- by Sweep Operator  
- PCA  
	- QR Decomposition  
	- Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Decomposition by Power Method  
- Logistic Regression  
- LASSO  
- Ridge Regression  
- Adaboost  
- Support Vector Machines  
- Perceptron Neural Networks  
- Additional
	- Tensorflow Neural Net
	- SAS Tutorial
	- Parallel Computing in R
